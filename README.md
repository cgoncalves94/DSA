# Data Structures and Algorithms in Python

## About this Repository

This repository serves as an educational resource for learning and implementing data structures and algorithms using Python. It contains a broad collection of data structures, each implemented with a focus on educational utility.

## Data Structures

Below are some of the key data structures covered in this repository:

### Linked Lists

- Supports adding, removing, and traversing through nodes.
    - [Singly Linked List](DataStructures/LinkedLists/linked_list.py)
    - [Doubly Linked List](DataStructures/LinkedLists/doubly_linked_list.py)
    - [Node](DataStructures/LinkedLists/node.py)

### Stacks

- A LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) data structure that efficiently handles push and pop operations.
    - [Stack](DataStructures/Stacks_and_Queues/stack.py)

### Queues

- A FIFO (First-In, First-Out) data structure for efficient enqueue and dequeue operations.
    - [Queue](DataStructures/Stacks_and_Queues/queue.py)

### Hash Maps

- Implements hash tables with chaining for collision resolution.
    - [Hash Map](DataStructures/HashMap/hash_map.py)

### Trees

- Features various tree data structures with methods for traversal, insertion, and deletion.
    - [Tree Node](DataStructures/Trees/tree_node.py)
    - [Binary Tree](DataStructures/Trees/binary_tree_node.py)
    - [Binary Search Tree](DataStructures/Trees/binary_search_tree_node.py)

### Graphs

- Contains graph data structures and traversal algorithms. Vertex objects serve as the fundamental units for constructing graphs.
    - [Graph](DataStructures/Graphs/graph.py)
    - [Vertex](DataStructures/Graphs/vertex.py)

### Heaps

- Coming soon.

## Algorithms
