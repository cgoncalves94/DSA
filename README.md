# Data Structures and Algorithms in Python

This repository implements common data structures and algorithms in Python. 

## Data Structures

### Linked Lists
- [Singly Linked List](DataStructures/LinkedLists/linked_list.py)
- [Doubly Linked List](DataStructures/LinkedLists/doubly_linked_list.py)
- [Node](DataStructures/LinkedLists/node.py)

Linked list implementations with support for adding, removing and traversing nodes.

### Stacks and Queues
- [Stack](DataStructures/Stacks_and_Queues/queue.py)  

LIFO data structure for push/pop operations. Based on arrays.

- [Queue](DataStructures/Stacks_and_Queues/queue.py)

FIFO data structure for enqueue/dequeue operations. Based on arrays. 

### Hash Maps  
- [Hash Map](DataStructures/HashMap/hash_map.py)

Hash table implementation using chaining for collision resolution. 

### Trees
- [Tree Node](DataStructures/Trees/tree_node.py)
- [Binary Tree](DataStructures/Trees/binary_tree_node.py)
- [Binary Search Tree](DataStructures/Trees/binary_search_tree_node.py)

Tree data structures with traversal, insertion and deletion methods.

### Graphs
- [Graph](DataStructures/Graphs/graph.py)
- [Vertex](DataStructures/Graphs/vertex.py) 

Graph and vertex classes with graph traversal algorithms.
